# kb-digitization-cloudapp

The "Digitization addon" lets system administrators in Alma send and receive items for digitization. The cloud app lets
them type in a barcode or 583 field and this will send a request to the Maestro flow that the item needs to be digitized.
They can also type in a collection of items with a code like "NKS-4_4737_1" and a list of items will appear to choose from.
